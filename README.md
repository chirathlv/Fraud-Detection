# Fraud Detection

Some fraudsters hack a credit card by making several small transactions (generally less than $2.00), which are typically ignored by cardholders.

By inspecting these transactions, It can be noticed that frequency of several users transactions which are less than $2.00, are unusually high. This can be potentially due to some hacking activities which the cardholder may have not yet identified.

This analysis has been done based on the data we have on our database and here you can find the Entity Relationship Diagram (ER Diagram) of the database
